## Obtaining
Spare Firearm Parts can be crafted at Workbench lvl 1 using a Leatherman Multitool and 1 Weapon Parts.
They can also be purchased from Mechanic LL2 and Flea.

## Usage
Fully repair the weapon you want to fix using either traders or the vanilla Weapon Repair Kit. ie. (87.2/87.2)
Drag the Spare Firearm Parts onto your weapon. You should see a notification popup and hear a sound depending on if the repair was successful or a failure.

### DO NOT USE THE SPARE FIREARM PARTS AS A REPAIR KIT VIA THE RIGHT CLICK->REPAIR WINDOW.
### THIS IS NOT THE INTENDED USAGE

## Known Issues
Spare Firearm Parts are visible is the Repair window, letting you repair a gun for just the 5 resource points it contains. This will act like a regular repair kit and will waste your Parts.
